- when rendering bannerView, draw the background from dataURI first, then according to
`this.props.whatToRender`, render the thing on top of the background, save it as dataURL and pass it to image.

- Think on how to process input from ImageSourcesBox.
- Download templates specified in store.
- Render banner per group


Notes:
- Upgrade material-ui when material-ui v0.15.0 is released and add it as dependency.
