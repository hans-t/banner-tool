- BUG: deleting source causes error:
Solution: `images` should be object, and source and image should have same id.

- Can REMOVE_BANNER_IDS for propsById not depend on bannerIds array?

- Work on texts page

- Refactor add-images-page/bridge.jsx

- Maximize available space. Example: source URLS container and results should be
separated by dividers not by cards. Read: https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/structure.html#structure-ui-regions


Notes:
- Upgrade material-ui when material-ui v0.15.0 is released and add it as dependency.
