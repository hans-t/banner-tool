- Refactor add-images-btn.jsx

- Bug: When going back to index page and then press addImages, tabs are missing.
Only after rendering banners.

- Bottleneck is at toDataURL. Try showing canvas instead of img elements.


Notes:
- Upgrade material-ui when material-ui v0.15.0 is released and add it as dependency.
