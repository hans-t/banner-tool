- Work getCombinations for texts.

- BUG: When deleting source, React throws. See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6538
Need to update React to v15.0.3 when available.

- Maximize available space. Example: source URLS container and results should be
separated by dividers not by cards. Read: https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/structure.html#structure-ui-regions

- BUG (LOW PRIORITY): When templates are selected, combinations are NOT updated.

Notes:
- Upgrade material-ui when material-ui v0.15.0 is released and add it as dependency.
