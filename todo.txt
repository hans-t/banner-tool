- instead of using dataURI when adding image, we can preload those images' dataURI to canvas
and when rendering banner, we just need to copy it from a canvas instead of loading from dataURI.

- Maximize available space. Example: source URLS container and results should be
separated by dividers not by cards. Read: https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/structure.html#structure-ui-regions

- users need to be able to select banners.



Notes:
- Upgrade material-ui when material-ui v0.15.0 is released and add it as dependency.
